          Possible Risks of Telemedicine: As with any medical procedure, there
          are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. Facility
          believes that the likelihood of these risks materializing is very low.
          These risks may include, without limitation, the following: Delays in
          medical evaluation and consultation or treatment may occur due to
          deficiencies or failures of the equipment which may include poor video
          and data quality. Security protocols could fail, causing a breach of
          privacy of personal medical information. Lack of access to complete
          medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic
          reactions or other negative outcomes. By accepting these Terms of Use,
          you acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following: You
          understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality
          of medical information also apply to telemedicine. Links are provided
          above to the Facility Notice of Privacy Practices and the Online Care
          Group Notice of Privacy Practices which explains this in greater
          detail. You understand that telemedicine may involve electronic
          communication of your personal medical information to medical
          practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of
          state. You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits
          from the use of telemedicine, but that no results can be guaranteed or
          assured. You understand that all information will be part of your
          medical record and available to you by printing the summary from the
          visit. This information will have the same restrictions on
          dissemination without your consent. Except to the extent already
          relied upon, you understand you may withdraw your consent at any time
          by emailing contact@medtech.africa to withdraw your consent and
          inactivate your account. You understand that your healthcare
          information may be shared with other individuals for treatment,
          payment and healthcare operations purposes. Psychotherapy notes are
          maintained by clinicians but are not shared with others, while billing
          codes and encounter summaries are shared with others. If you obtain
          psychotherapy services, you understand that your therapist has the
          right to limit the information provided to you if in your therapist's
          professional judgment sharing the information with you would be
          harmful to you. You further understand that your healthcare
          information may be shared in the following circumstances: When a valid
          court order is issued for medical records. Reporting suspected abuse,
          neglect, or domestic violence. Preventing or reducing a serious threat
          to anyone's health or safety.

          Dispute Resolution (Arbitration Clause).

          Binding Arbitration. You and Facility each agree to submit to binding

          breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof

          connection with the Site. The arbitration will be held in the State of
          [FACILITY STATE] before one arbitrator on an individual basis and not
          as a class action. You expressly waive any right you may have to
          arbitrate a dispute as a class action. Arbitration Final. The
          arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal
          Arbitration Act, and not any state law concerning arbitration, governs
          all arbitration under this clause. Any court having jurisdiction may
          enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. If any part of this clause,
          other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be
          unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable.
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the
          waiver of class action rights contained herein is not enforceable as
          to any person or persons, such non-enforceability shall apply to such
          person or persons only, and all other persons shall continue to be
          governed by the Arbitration Clause. Giving Up Right of Class Action.
          These Terms provides that all Disputes will be resolved by binding
          arbitration and not in court or by jury trial. IF A DISPUTE IS
          ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS
          REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST
          FACILITY ENTITIES INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY
          CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS
          INCLUDES GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
